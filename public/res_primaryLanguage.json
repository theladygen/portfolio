    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Genevieve DuPuy, she/her, and I'm a full stack software dev based just north of Seattle in beautiful rural Snohomish, WA. Before diving into tech my background ran the gamut from customer service, to the restaurant industry, to teaching dance. Most recently my work has been as a small business owner and esthetician/sugarist. I'm passionate about working with people and stretching myself creatively. In building my own business I always wished for more tech savvy, so one of my goals is to use my experience in software development to help creatives and other small business folx bring their visions to life online, and in doing so, enrich local community. I love that there is always something new and exciting around the corner to learn, especially in the world of tech, and I'm looking forward to contributing to its diversification by adding my own unique voice to the mix. ðŸ’œ",
